# MaterialTransferSimulator
System to simulate the storage and movement of materials across a civil construction site.
To assist with the planning of adequate sizing of stockpiles over the duration of a site.

Consists of:
(1) core classes, Simulation, Container, Transfer that handle the numbers
(2) WPF (for now) UI for defining the object variables and running a simulation 
(3) a set of plugins for (vanilla) autocad to build model instances of containers relating to a given day
(4) a utility to build the correct acvitiy data into Synchro Pro with references to models (3) so that the material movements can be visualised in tandem with the main works programme
